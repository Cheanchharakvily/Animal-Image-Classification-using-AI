# Animal Image Classification Using AI

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an AI-based system to classify images of animals into predefined categories. Leveraging deep learning models and image processing techniques, the system is designed to accurately identify and classify various animal species from input images.

---

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of animals for classification.
- **Model Accuracy:** Utilizes a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to ensure high classification accuracy.
- **Scalability:** Supports additional animal categories with minimal retraining.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and intuitive interface for image uploads and result display.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Frameworks/Libraries:**
  - TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the AI model
  - Flask API: To serve the web application
  - NumPy & Pandas: For data handling and manipulation
- **Dataset:**
  - A collection of labeled animal images organized into folders by category.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Animal-Image-Classification-using-AI.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Animal-Image-Classification-using-AI
   ```
3. You need to specify your own model which you trained. Or you can use the Animal-Detection.ipynb to train yourself.

## Usage
1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
3. Upload an image of an animal and view the classification result.

## Project Workflow
1. **Image Preprocessing:**
   - Resize and normalize images.
   - Convert images to arrays suitable for the AI model.
2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Use a CNN to extract features from the image.
3. **Prediction:**
   - Classify the image based on the trained model.
4. **Output:**
   - Display the predicted category on the web interface.

## Dataset Details
- I use just normal images of 12 classes of animals, you can train with as many class of animals but it will take alot of times. The dataset can be expanded with additional labeled images for further training.
- I use around 7,500 images in 12 folder of different animals to trained, each folder should have at least 500+ images. but smaller database can be done.

## Future Improvements
- **Add More Categories:** Extend the dataset to include more animal species.
- **Mobile-Friendly Interface:** Enhance the web interface for better compatibility with mobile devices.
- **Real-Time Classification:** Implement real-time image capture and classification using a webcam.
